# Song-recommender
A simple python program to recommend a random song based on the user's choice of category.
The user is asked to pick a category of songs and according to that the program outputs a random name from a previously set list.
A more advanced form can be based on something new to the user or favourite.
Another step can be a way to play the song through the code.
It's my learning process!
